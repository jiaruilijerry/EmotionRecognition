## Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to the `fer2013` emotion recognition model project developed by [Shankar Shastri (gitshanks)](https://github.com/gitshanks). Our project has used the `fer2013` repository as a foundational reference for understanding and developing emotion recognition models. The insights and code from this project have significantly contributed to our ability to further train and enhance our model. We appreciate the effort put into creating and sharing such a valuable resource with the community.
